# Touchbox
Bringing people living with dementia and informal carers together through music and physical contact.

Project by PinkTomate - Beach Bagenal, Bente Vonk, Obafemi Omitiran & Simo Paraschi. Code by: Simo Paraschi

Touchbox is a connection & musical interface that invites a person with dementia (PwD) and their informal carer to sit together and generate music through physical contact. It is the result of a participatory design approach, where we discovered the relational challenge that dementia poses between the PwD and the informal carer.

# Tools required:
- 2 light-dependent resistor(LDRs)
- p5.js editor

# How it works
The LDRs are placed on top of the Touchbox. In order to start a song, they should be covered by the PwD and the informal carer. When the LDRs are covered, signals are sent using the MQTT protocol to the p5.js sketch and a song is played.
